Nash's Config Files
===================

This is a set of my config files.  There is nothing deep here, and I try to
keep my configuration changes small.

I welcome suggestions/pull-requests for improvements.

Install
-------

   ./update.pl

This will create the links in your home directory.

Future work
-----------

   - Allow it to merge machine specific changes.
   - Make the vim plugins submodules.
